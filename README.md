# demo-CKEditor

This is a simple demonstration of the new [UploadCare](https://uploadcare.com) feature for the [CKEditor5](https://ckeditor.com). Check the [docs](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/file-management/uploadcare.html) for more information.

First, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add the CKEditor5 License key and the UploadCare Public Key to it.

Once it's done, use [vite](https://vite.dev) with npm to run the demo:

```shell
npx vite
```

You can now use the [demo](http://localhost:5173).
