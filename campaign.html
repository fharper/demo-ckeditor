        This page shows a demo of the CKEdtitor Uploadcare feature. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/fharper/demo-uploadcare">GitHub</a>.

        <h2>List of places where I would share this video.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I would add the demonstration code in a GitHub repository under the <a href="https://github.com/ckeditor">ckeditor organization</a> on GitHub, and the README file would contain the video.</li>
            <li>I would share the video on <a href="https://x.com/ckeditor/">Twitter</a>.</li>
            <li>I would share the video on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ckeditor/">LinkedIn</a>.</li>
            <li>In the spirit of scaling everything I do, I would write a blog post or a tutorial on how to use it that would be the text-based equivalent of the video, with the video embedded for more visual folks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>This video is a pure product pitch, and no developer like those, so I would probably limit sharing on our mediums and not externally, except if there is a specific request from potential users. To maximize the visibility of this new feature, I would work with potential partners to create video content (either a new recording, or livestreams/webinars) to do cross-marketing. One example would be to work with Dropbox or Microsoft, since there is a upload source like Dropbox and OneDrive. For any other type of content, I go where they go: dev.to, Reddit, meetups, conferences...</p>

        <h2>What I would track (KPIs)</h2>

        <p>For any specific devrel initiative, I try to limit the KPIs to 2-3 maximum. The goal is not to overwhelm anyone with numbers, but to ensure that we are going in the right direction. These would apply to any video content, not just this video.</p>

        <h3>Developer Hours</h3>
        <p>Time is the most precious currency anyone has. One way to see if any type of content is valuable for the target audience is to measure the number of hours the developers gave to you. In other words, I would measure the usefulness of this short video tutorial in terms of how many hours of it has been watched. I feel like it's a better KPI than the number of views cause it gives you the opportunity to track your success equally no matter the video length. Ten views of a 5-minute videos do not equal 10 views of a 30-minute one.</p>

        <h3>New (Community) Users</h3>
        <p>This would be critical to understand the impact, but it would be impossible at first since there is no CKEditor community. We could see if we have new users using CKEditor, and I assume you have observability in place to track features usage, but it's impossible to say with everything developer relations is doing, which efforts helped a specific aspect. To make it easier, we would need to create a Slack or Discord server to create and foster a healthy community. I'm happy to discuss about that, but I feel like it's missing â€” it's usually the first thing I put in place at a new company when they didn't have devrel before.</p>

        <p></p>It will help foster a human-centric culture around the product, make it easier to support the users, and make it easier to create champions. With this community, I usually welcome everyone joining the community with one question: where did they hear from us. In the past it helped me more easily track the return on investment of my different approaches on places where it would be harder to track, like with a video uploaded on YouTube. Obviously, I could add UTM tracking to CKEditor URLs added in the video description, but it wouldn't be as effective to also get valuable feedback from the users.</p>

        <h3>Developer happiness</h3>
        <p>It will also be hard to do without a proper community, but based on where I'm sharing the videos, and the YouTube comments themselves, the comments would help us understand if the video was useful, but even more important, is the documentation is helpful, and if the feature is helping the users fill a pain point they had, or give a better experience for their usage of CKEditor.</p>
